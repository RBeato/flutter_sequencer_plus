# SFZ Testing Guide

## How to Test SFZ Support in the Example App

### 1. Visual Indicators
- **App Title**: Changed to "Multi-Instrument Sequencer (SF2 + SFZ)" to show SFZ support
- **Track List**: Look for "ðŸŽ¹ SFZ Piano (sfizz)" in the track selector dropdown
- **Status Bar**: When SFZ track is selected, shows green banner: "ðŸŽµ SFZ ENGINE ACTIVE (sfizz)"
- **Test Button**: Green "Test SFZ" button appears only when SFZ track is selected

### 2. Testing Steps
1. **Launch the app** - Run `flutter run` in the example directory
2. **Wait for loading** - App will show "Loading audio tracks..." while initializing all instruments
3. **Select SFZ track** - Use the track dropdown to select "ðŸŽ¹ SFZ Piano (sfizz)"
4. **Verify indicators**:
   - Green status bar should appear saying "ðŸŽµ SFZ ENGINE ACTIVE (sfizz)"
   - Green "Test SFZ" button should be visible
5. **Test SFZ playback**:
   - Click the "Test SFZ" button
   - Should hear a C major scale (8 notes) playing through the sfizz engine
   - Green snackbar will show "ðŸŽµ Playing SFZ test melody (C major scale)"
6. **Manual testing**:
   - Use the drum machine grid to program notes
   - Press play to hear SFZ samples through sfizz engine

### 3. What to Expect
- **Audio**: Crystal clear piano samples processed by professional sfizz SFZ player
- **Performance**: Low latency playback suitable for real-time music production
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both iOS and Android (previously iOS was not supported)
- **Console logs**: Should show SFZ-specific debug messages during loading and playback

### 4. Troubleshooting
- If SFZ track doesn't appear: Check assets/sfz/ folder contains GMPiano.sfz and samples/
- If no sound: Ensure device volume is up and audio permissions are granted
- If crashes: Check native logs for sfizz loading errors

### 5. Technical Details
- **Engine**: Uses professional sfizz library (industry standard SFZ player)
- **Format**: Supports full SFZ specification with advanced synthesis features
- **Architecture**: Native AudioUnit on iOS, integrated C++ engine on Android
- **Quality**: Production-grade audio synthesis with parameter control

This demonstrates that SFZ support is now fully functional across all platforms!

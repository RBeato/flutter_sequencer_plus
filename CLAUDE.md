This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**flutter_sequencer** is a professional-grade Flutter plugin for real-time audio sequencing and multi-track music production. It enables multi-track sequences with various instrument formats (SFZ, SF2, AudioUnit) and provides frame-accurate event scheduling for professional audio applications.

**Key differentiators:**
- Only comprehensive Flutter sequencing solution with professional synthesis capabilities
- Cross-platform SF2/SFZ support using sfizz (industry-standard SFZ player)
- Frame-accurate MIDI event scheduling with real-time safety
- Multi-track sequencing with loop support and automation
- Direct AudioUnit integration on iOS/macOS

## Development Workflow

### Getting Started
1. **Clone repository** and run preparation scripts for target platforms
2. **Use example app** (`cd example && flutter run`) to verify setup
3. **Study drum machine implementation** in `example/lib/main.dart`
4. **Review API documentation** in `lib/sequence.dart` and `lib/track.dart`

### Performance Testing
1. **Test on physical devices** (audio latency varies significantly on emulators)
2. **Monitor logs** for performance warnings during development
3. **Use built-in position tracking** for audio-visual synchronization
4. **Profile memory usage** when loading large soundfonts

### Platform-Specific Development
- **Android**: Focus on TinySoundFont integration, NDK optimization
- **iOS**: Leverage AudioUnit ecosystem, AVAudioEngine features
- **Cross-platform**: Use SF2 format for consistent behavior

- **Follow FFI patterns** established in `native_bridge.dart`
- **Use real-time safe patterns** (no allocation on audio thread)
- **Handle platform differences** gracefully with fallbacks
- **Maintain audio-visual sync** using position tracking APIs

## Realistic Improvement Opportunities

- Integration with existing audio engine components

## Current Decisions
1. Architecture Support:
   - Primary focus on arm64 and x86_64
   - Explicit exclusion of i386 for simulators
2. Build Configuration:
   - Use of umbrella header pattern
   - Simplified public API exposure
   - C++17 standard requirement
   - Disabled Bitcode (deprecated in newer Xcode)
3. Module Organization:
   - Single public umbrella header
   - Strict control over public API surface
   - Clear separation of implementation details
4. Using C-style interface for core scheduler functionality
5. Implementing debug logging for development and testing
6. Planning for thread-safe operation
7. Keeping implementation minimal initially for testing

## Current Focus: iOS Compatibility with Flutter 3.29.1 and Modernizing the Build Process

The current focus is on making the plugin compatible with Flutter 3.29.1 on iOS, creating stub implementations for the audio engine to allow the app to build and run even without the full audio functionality, and updating the overall architecture for modern iOS development.

### Recent Changes

1. **iOS Flutter 3.29.1 Compatibility Updates**
   - Simplified Swift code to avoid AUAudioUnit implementation errors
   - Created a basic stub implementation for SfizzAU Swift class
   - Implemented C stubs for sfizz API to avoid linking errors
   - Updated podspec for modern iOS and Apple Silicon compatibility
   - Removed Swift bridging header approach in favor of direct Swift implementation

2. **Build System Improvements**
   - Updated prepare.sh script to build a minimal stub library instead of actual sfizz
   - Modified the library creation process to support both iOS devices and simulators
   - Fixed architecture-specific configuration for Apple Silicon Macs
   - Added proper error handling in build scripts

3. **C API Stub Implementation**
   - Created stub header files (sfizz.h) to define the C API interface
   - Implemented minimal C functions that return success without actual functionality
   - Ensured Swift code can interface with the C stubs correctly

4. **Swift Code Simplification**
   - Simplified SfizzAU.swift to be a standalone class without AUAudioUnit dependency
   - Removed complex AudioUnit initialization that was causing errors
   - Created minimal implementations that provide the necessary interfaces

5. **Build Configuration Updates**
   - Updated podspec to use modern settings for iOS 12+
   - Fixed architecture settings for Apple Silicon (arm64, arm64e, x86_64)
   - Improved header search paths for proper compilation
   - Removed deprecated settings and bridging headers

### Current Status

The plugin has been significantly simplified for iOS compatibility with Flutter 3.29.1. We've created stub implementations that allow the app to build and run, while avoiding complex dependencies that were causing build failures. This approach provides a minimal working implementation that can be expanded later.

We still need to verify that the app builds and runs successfully on iOS simulators and devices. Once we have a working build, we can progressively enhance the audio functionality as needed.

### Next Steps

1. **Complete iOS Build Testing**
   - Finish troubleshooting the remaining bridging header reference issue
   - Test on both iOS simulators and physical devices
   - Verify that initialization and basic UI functionality works

2. **Implement Minimal Audio Feedback**
   - Once the app builds, add minimal audio feedback functionality
   - Ensure basic UI interactions work even without full audio engine
   - Consider adding stub implementations for core audio functions

3. **Document Build Process**
   - Update documentation with modern build process details
   - Create clear instructions for iOS build configuration
   - Document potential issues and solutions for future reference

4. **Performance Testing**
   - Test UI performance on various iOS devices
   - Identify any bottlenecks in the simplified implementation
   - Ensure the app remains responsive even without audio functionality

5. **Test Example Application**
   - Verify that the example application builds and runs correctly
   - Test all UI functionality including step sequencer, transport, etc.
   - Ensure the app doesn't crash when attempting audio operations

### Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Stub Implementation Strategy**
   - Created minimalist stub implementations that return success without actual functionality
   - Focused on making the app build and run rather than full audio implementation
   - Used C stubs to avoid complex C++ dependencies

2. **iOS Architecture Support**
   - Supporting arm64, arm64e (Apple Silicon) and x86_64 architectures
   - Dropping support for i386 to focus on modern devices
   - Configuring both device and simulator builds

3. **Swift Implementation**
   - Simplified Swift code to avoid complex AudioUnit dependencies
   - Focusing on basic class interfaces without complex initialization
   - Using direct Swift implementation rather than bridging headers

4. **Build Script Approach**
   - Updated prepare.sh to create minimal stub libraries
   - Added better error handling and architecture-specific compilation
   - Created a more robust build process with proper error reporting

## Recent Technical Challenges

1. **iOS Build System Complexity**
   - Issues with the bridging header approach in framework targets
   - Complex dependencies between Swift, Objective-C, and C++ code
   - Challenges with XCConfig settings and module mapping

2. **Architecture Support**
   - Ensuring proper architecture support for Apple Silicon Macs
   - Supporting both simulator and device builds with the same codebase
   - Managing fat library creation for multiple architectures

3. **Swift Evolution**
   - Adapting to changes in Swift's interoperability with C/C++
   - Handling deprecated features and evolving Swift functionality
   - Working with modern Swift patterns for audio applications

## Production Timeline

- **Current Phase**: iOS Build System Fixes and Stub Implementation
- **Next Phase**: Testing and Verification (1 week)
- **Final Phase**: Documentation and Release Preparation (1 week)

Expected time to production-ready status: approximately 2 weeks.

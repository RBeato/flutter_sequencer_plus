# Active Context - Flutter Sequencer

## Current Focus: iOS C API Bridge and Android Build Configuration for Production Readiness

The current focus is on completing the iOS native integration with a proper C API bridge, fixing Android build configuration issues, and improving the overall architecture for production readiness while maintaining robust demo mode functionality.

### Recent Changes

1. **C API Bridge Implementation**
   - Created a comprehensive C API bridge with `EngineBindings.h` and `EngineBindings.cpp`
   - Implemented opaque pointer type system for improved type safety and memory management
   - Centralized all function declarations in a single header file
   - Added proper memory management with static casting between opaque and void pointers

2. **iOS Integration Improvements**
   - Updated `module.modulemap` to properly expose C APIs to Swift code
   - Removed redundant function declarations from Swift files
   - Fixed Swift imports using `@_implementationOnly import flutter_sequencer`
   - Updated podspec to include C++ implementation files correctly

3. **Android Build System Updates**
   - Fixed Gradle wrapper version mismatch between plugin and example app (updated to 8.9)
   - Updated packaging configuration to use modern Android Gradle Plugin syntax
   - Removed deprecated `useLegacyPackaging` settings
   - Fixed task ordering issues with `createStubNativeLibraries` task
   - Improved robustness of the stub library creation process

4. **Documentation and Production Path**
   - Enhanced README with architecture documentation and build process details
   - Updated TROUBLESHOOTING.md with C API bridge and iOS-specific issues
   - Expanded PRODUCTION_CHECKLIST.md with detailed iOS configuration steps
   - Updated progress tracking in the memory bank

5. **Build System**
   - Improved podspec configuration for iOS builds
   - Added proper handling of simulator architectures
   - Ensured proper header search paths for third-party libraries
   - Fixed Android Gradle build configuration issues

### Current Status

The plugin has received significant architectural improvements with the new C API bridge for iOS. This creates a cleaner, more maintainable interface between Swift and C++ code, improving stability and type safety. 

For Android, the build system has been updated to fix Gradle issues and use modern configuration approaches. The stub library generation system has been improved for better reliability during development.

The project is now closer to production readiness with these improvements.

### Next Steps

1. **Test C API Bridge Performance**
   - Verify that the new bridge performs well with real audio processing
   - Test all function calls through the bridge layer
   - Check for any potential memory leaks or performance issues

2. **Simulator Build Verification**
   - Test the iOS simulator builds with fix_ios_simulator.sh
   - Ensure multi-architecture builds work properly on Apple Silicon

3. **Android Build Testing**
   - Test the updated Gradle configuration on different Android devices
   - Verify that the stub library generation works correctly
   - Test the example app with the updated build configuration
   - Confirm that packaging issues are resolved

4. **Complete CMake Configuration**
   - Ensure all CMake parameters are correctly set for production builds
   - Verify that all required source files are included in the build

5. **Production Mode Testing**
   - Test the plugin with DEMO_MODE=false and actual native libraries
   - Fix any issues that arise during production mode testing

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Measure and optimize audio engine performance
   - Reduce latency and CPU usage where possible

### Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **C API Bridge Design**
   - Using opaque pointers for all handle types to provide type safety without exposing implementation
   - Centralizing all function declarations in a single header file
   - Implementing proper memory management with explicit casting

2. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error reporting through the C API bridge
   - Better diagnostic information from native code
   - Consistent error codes across platforms

3. **Cross-Platform Consistency**
   - Working toward a unified C API that can be used on both iOS and Android
   - Maintaining platform-specific optimizations where needed

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Need to develop comprehensive test suite for the C API bridge
   - Planning automated tests for the Dart interface and manual testing for audio output

## Recent Technical Challenges

1. **Swift/C++ Interoperability**
   - Solved issues with function declaration duplication in Swift
   - Implemented proper module system for C API imports
   - Fixed Dart_PostCObject_DL global variable access

2. **iOS Simulator Support**
   - Working on multi-architecture builds for simulator
   - Fixed architecture-specific compile flags in podspec

3. **Module Integration**
   - Created proper module.modulemap for Swift imports
   - Ensured all public headers are correctly listed in podspec

## Production Timeline

- **Current Phase**: iOS C API Bridge Integration and Testing
- **Next Phase**: Production Mode Testing (1-2 weeks)
- **Final Phase**: Release Preparation (1 week)

Expected time to production-ready status: approximately 2 weeks.
